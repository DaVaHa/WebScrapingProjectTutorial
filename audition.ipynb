They are called the [American Association of Wine Economists](https://www.wine-economics.org) and yes, they even publish papers! A decade ago, they published the interesting paper titled \"[Do More Expensive Wines Taste Better?](http://www.wine-economics.org/aawe/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/AAWE_WP16.pdf)\". With the use of blind tastings, they discovered that the correlation between price and rating is actually *negative*. This means it doesn't make sense for the average individual to pay more for wine! Surprising, right? However, they did find a positive correlation between price and rating for trained wine experts. In this project, you will find out if you can reproduce this positive relationship and along the way, discover the maximum price you should pay for a bottle of wine!\n",

We also can see on the graph that the rating doesn't really increase anymore as soon we pay around 60 dollars a bottle. Thus, spending $100 for a bottle of wine will not bring us more enjoyment. Instead, two bottles for 50 dollars each seems the *data driven* way to maximize our enjoyment! ;)"
